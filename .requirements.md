# Requirements Zoo Simulation System

## Minimum Requirements (Core Functionality)

- [x] Implement an object-oriented zoo simulation system.
- [x] Include a base Animal class with common attributes such as name, age, and energy level.
- [x] Include subclasses for different animal types (for example Herbivores and Carnivores).
- [x] Implement at least three concrete animal species with unique behaviors.
- [x] Include a Visitor class that can interact with animals (for example feeding them).
- [x] Simulate at least one full day in the zoo where animals eat, sleep, and interact.
- [x] Demonstrate inheritance and method overriding.
- [x] The program must run without errors and clearly show the simulation flow through
output.

## Extended Requirements (Improved Design & Behavior)

- [x] Manage animal energy levels consistently across all actions.
- [x] Implement meaningful interactions between animals (for example hunting, playing, or
resting).
- [x] Ensure that behaviors affect future simulation steps, not just printed output.
- [x] Structure the simulation so that it can run for multiple days without code changes.
- [] Reduce duplicated logic through proper class design.
- [] Demonstrate thoughtful use of encapsulation and reuse.

## Advanced Requirements (High-Quality Simulation Design)

- [x] Make it easy to add new animal species without modifying existing logic.
- [x] Maintain a balanced predator-prey system that avoids unrealistic extinction.
- [x] Separate simulation logic from execution logic.
- [] Handle edge cases gracefully, regardless of interaction order.
- [x] Write clean, readable code with clear structure and comments where needed.
- [] Demonstrate deliberate and well-reasoned design choices.

## Optional Extension Tasks

- [x] Allow the simulation to run for a configurable number of days.
- [] Introduce random events that influence animal or visitor behavior.
- [x] Add a simple text-based interface for user interaction.
- [x] Track and display statistics such as energy levels or population changes over time.
